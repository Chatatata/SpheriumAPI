defmodule SpheriumWebService.Permission do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a permission.

  Permission is an abstract model, which may inherited by different types of
  permissions. Therefore, the model itself does not define a valid permission.

  Permissions determine the user accessibility on some kind of operation.
  Suppose you want to authorize a user to revoke an action in web server,
  to do such thing, user should have a valid permission set with required
  permissions attached.

  ## Grant powers

  Permissions also have a `:required_grant_power` property, which determines
  the required minimum grant power in terms of possessibility by a permission
  set. A permission with `x` required grant power could be possessed by a
  permission set with `y` grant power if and only if `x â‰¤ y`.

  ## Immutability and determinism

  Permissions are immutable, and its types have deterministic sizes. There
  could not be infinite amount of possible permissions in some kind.
  Permissions could be nil-bound, however they are not garbage collected
  (i.e. vacuumed).
